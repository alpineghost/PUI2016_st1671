In this homework, we continue work on the hypothesis and different test.
In the first part I reviewed a classmate's hypothesis, the data he choosed was normally distributied 
thus I think do a z-test will be a good choice.

In the second part, we have a chance to practice our knowlege of different statistic reseach method.
The paper I chooses was a reseach about the association between snuff using and endothelial functions.
The research result turn out to be snuff using will reduce endothelial functions, the it is an ancova reseach
include one independent varialble one dependet varilale and several control variables. The main control variable
is age, while the researcher also include income in the reseach.

In the third part we perform z-test and chi-square test on same dataset, the progress was shown in the code.
Even though we do diffrent type pf test, the conclusion was same, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, the result didn't
surprised me, because the diffrence between the two percentage wasn't very big.

In the fourth part, we performed more types of test with python scipy pacakge.
From my understanding, the KS test aimed testing the likelihood of two sample distributions. While the pearson and spears test 
are more aiming at test the correlation between two samples.
