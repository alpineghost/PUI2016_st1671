In this assignment we begin to learn how to use python to solve statistical problems.
In the first part of our homework, we creat different size of sample to perform their distribution
and we find that as the sample size become larger and larger their distributio will more like the population distribution.
In the second part, we try to generate a null hypothesis.
In my idea I guess the age of male rider are greater than women rider, since the data were colleted in same period, so I just use their
birth year.
In the third part we try to do a Z-test. 
I have my null hypotheis that the population mean will be samller than 34.
In this problem I found that we dont have the the population standard deviation,so I just use the sample one.

For some reason this homework I worked alone. Hope I did them right.
