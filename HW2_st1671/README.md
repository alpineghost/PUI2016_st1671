In this homework, we finished two task.

The first is knowing how to read the JSON data and write it in to a csv file.
Second is reading data with panda, try to revise dataframe and creat plots with data in the datafram.
In the first part I met some probelm inn how to pull the data I need form the data set, which is nestes.
I worked with Yao Wang and Yuan Shi, we found that there were two types of variable in the data, list in dictionary and dictionary in list.
The way we pull the data was like peel an onion. I am not sure is this the efficient way, but luckily it worked out.
In the panda reading part I just followed what the professor did in the class.
