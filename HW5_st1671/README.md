This homework we worked on linear regression and try to fit population distriutions.
In assignment 1 part3, first I want to test a poisson distirution and srucked at the chi-square test
of the poisson distribution.Thus finally I test the exponential distribution.
In assignmen 2, I asked dongjie and yuan for help.
In assigment 3, we practiced build null hypothesis, which we should pay attentin to is we need make sure
what we want to test, thus indicat the null hypothesis as oppositely.
