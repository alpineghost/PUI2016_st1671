In this homework, I tried to work with the github and learn some command used in my terminal to build my computer enviroment.

Problem 1

First, I registered my own github account so that I can build my own repository. Then I tried to link the repository with my local file so that I can push the file locally to the github.
Then I tried to fork my classmates's repo and let her fork my repos.
In oder to do this I clone her folder to my machine and revised it in my shell, after that I pushed the revised file and sent a pull request to her, so that she can accept the pull request and merge my revised file with her original one.

Problem 2
In this problem I wrote some command to make a "shortcut" of my directory, which is make a enviromental variable.
