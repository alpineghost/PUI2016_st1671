CLARITY:

The plot is a sccatter plot showed the number of trips made in each hour of a day. The label of this plot is very clear, such as
the title, it indicated the characteristics showed in the plot. Which helps my understanding very much. I think this plot is clear and
easy to read.

ESTHETIC:

The grid is a very good thing for readers to read the plot. If ask for my suggestion,I would say the plot may be prettier if we have a different background color. 

HONESTY:    

The poins showed a clear pattern.I think this plot described the dataset very well.
