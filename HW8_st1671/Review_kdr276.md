CLARITY:     

The plot is a sccatter plot showed the median income of female and male from different group.The x-axis is the income of male and the y-axis is the income of female which is a little confused.I think histogram may be a better choice in this situation.

ESTHETIC:    

The plot is very clean and the color is very eye-firendly. The legend also easy to read.

HONESTY:     

The plot honestly reproducing the data, but as I mentioned before, in my opinion, a hisogram may be a better choice if we want compare the median income of female and male.
