CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?
The plot is missing some information that would help it make it clear. Here are some suggestions to help make it clearer to the reader. 
•	Include a title that describes what you’re plotting across all four graphs, maybe something like “The relationship between altitude and temperature”
•	Provide a label for the X-axis and Y-axis and include the units.
•	Add a legend that identifies what the colors and the different lines represent
It would also be helpful for you to include a caption describing what the plots are showing and your interpretation and analysis of the plots.

ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

The plots make a good use of color to represent different lines. To make it more esthetic, the plots could be shown at a larger scale.

HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
The plots represent the data without deforming it and it is clear that the altitude and temperature have a negative correlation.
